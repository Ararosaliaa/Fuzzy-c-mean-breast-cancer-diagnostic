🧬 Fuzzy C-Means Breast Cancer Diagnostic

Diagnosing breast cancer using a custom implementation of the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm in Python — without using any machine-learning libraries.

📌 Overview

This project implements the Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm from scratch to cluster breast cancer diagnostic data into two categories. FCM allows each data point to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership, making it suitable for medical datasets that contain uncertainty or overlapping patterns.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how FCM works at a mathematical and algorithmic level, while also providing an interpretable clustering result for breast cancer diagnosis.
